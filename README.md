# Pytorch - A very simple implementation of FCN8s

This is an implementation of the FCN8s [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation] (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf).


## Requirements

In addition to Python 3, Pytorch Version>= 0.3.1, and Matlab the following packages are required:

numpy
scipy
pillow
matplotlib

These packages can be installed by running `pip3 install numpy scipy pillow matplotlib`.

## Usage

### Train the network
use net.train() method to train the network

### Test the network
run net.test() method to test the network
